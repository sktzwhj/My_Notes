Initially, I think this paper is somewhat doing the exact thing I want. However, it turns out it's different. 

The idea of this paper is to find the primary features for the input data and then remove the training example which is highly correlated to some existing training
data. 

However, that's might be the reason why they choose DNN rather than CNN as the model. Because the primary reason in CNN is hard to find out by methods like partial 
mutual information, etc.
