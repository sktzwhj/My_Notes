Write amplifications from file systems include:
(1) jounaling
(2) metadata sync (?)
(3) page-aligned update

Interesting discovery:
(1) the increased density of flash memory requires finer voltage steps inside each cell, which is less tolerant to leakage 
and noise interference. 

(2) metadata updates make things worse. We can imagine the write mechanism of ssd, since metadata needs to be written in a 
sync manner, that means, this small writes can only return after the write has been finished. However, small write on SSD 
is very slow. 

(3) apart from metadata, small write is the same. 

The idea of this paper is to propose an object-based flash translation layer design. To this end, the mechanisms are co-
designed with flash memory. By leveraging page metadata, OFTL enables lazy persistence.
