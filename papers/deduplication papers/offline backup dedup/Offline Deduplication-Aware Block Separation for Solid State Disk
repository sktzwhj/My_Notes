This paper also focuses on the lifespan problem of SSD devices. 

Dedup can be performed offline or inline. inline dedup examines the incoming data and prevent duplicate writes. offline dedup do the 
deduplication in spare time. but offline is not suitable for some scenarios (e.g., to improve the lifespan of SSDs ) since the data 
has already been written to the disk. 

But in some cases, offline dedup might be useful for garbage collection. e.g., if duplicated data has been invalidated by the offline 
dedup system, then the GC does not need to copy the data during garbage collection.

The core idea of this paper is to divide the space in SSD into unique region and not-detetmined region. 

CRC is used to determine whether a data chunk should be put into ND region. So a lot of data blocks in ND region is actually duplicated
data (the collision rate for CRC is very low. )
