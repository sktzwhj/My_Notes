Conventional deduplication techniques do not yield good storage efficiency savings for video data. Because even the content
of video is the same, the closed-captioning, text overlay, language and vedio resolution may be different. 

this paper uses content-aware algorthim to deal with video compression 

compression(video compression is in file-level)

The authors try some different deduplication schemes in terms deduplication ratio and metadata overhead on two different 
datasets. 

fixed-size, variable-size, sample-based, sequence-based. 

The dataset is like this, 

some are content variations (e.g., same video with different languages) and some others are video segment(same video with 
different start, end time)

application-level hints can be used in these ways. 

(1) how to route chunks 

(2) how to divide chunks
