This paper argues that scaling the already successful backup deduplication is very difficult. 

To be specific, especially for interleaved data for which multiple backup streams are combined to improve the efficiency of backup. 
So the purpose of this paper is to improve this scenario. 

本文将路由算法总结为两类， 一个是Min Hash这样，基于文件的内容来route （注意这是一种无状态的路由协议），另一个是Auction,看当前哪个节点含有和要路由的数据相似最多
的节点。

本文提出一种叫做sticky auction的路由算法。
