cnn tailored image compression...

The idea is just amazing. The original JPEG compression is not aware of the content of the image. Therefore, some import parts of the image may have a very low-quality visual quality. So this paper uses deep convolution networks to recogonize the semantically important parts of the images and gives these parts higher visual quality during the lossy compression.
