Compared to backup deduplication, there are some new problems when data dedup is used in primary data. 

(1) high dedup ratio no longer hold as data composition and growth is not driven by regular backup cycle. 

(2) performance sensitive due to on-disk fragmentation issue resulting from deduplication 

(3) dedup system must limit its usage of resources such that it does not impact the performance or scalability of the primary workload. 

Some studies in this paper: 

(1) larger chunk size, lower dedup ratio. 
(2) chunk compressibility 

The contributions of this paper: 
(1) resolve the conflicts of chunk size and dedup ratio. High dedup savings achieved by 4KB chunks size are attainable with larger
64KB chunks with chunk compression. as the loss of dedup opportunities arising from use of larger chunk sizes can be 
canceled by increased compressibitlity of the larger chunks. 

The authors believe that primary storage systems should use post-deduplication rather than in-line for the high demand of
latency. (however, for some use cases, for instance, ssd, post-processing deduplication hurts)
