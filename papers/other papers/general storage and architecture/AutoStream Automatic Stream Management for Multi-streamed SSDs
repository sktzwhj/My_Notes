Multi-stream SSD can isolate data with different life time to disparate erase blocks, thus reduce garbage collection overhead and improve overall 
SSD performance. 

SSD can be written/programmed at page level while can only be erased by block level. 

So the benefits of using multi-stream SSD is that data with different update frequency can be positioned at different streams. So that it is likely 
that data in the same block would be erased together. In conventional SSD, a block is likely to be mixed of valid and invalid pages. Therefore, 
we may need to copy a lot of valid data to other blocks during the garbage collection. 

Before, the stream assign is based on the hints given by applications, this paper actually gives a automatic detection solution to automatically
tag the data blocks. 

Looks quite similar to our paper. Hah...
