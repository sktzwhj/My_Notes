这篇文章和应该是FAST'16上那些host-side cache的前驱。　

有一个很有意思的分类是他们把cache分为两类：
1. datapath cache， 指的是那些一旦发生miss就需要进行cache update从而使得上层的应用或者硬件可以读取到数据的
2. non-datapath cache, 指的是不需要在每次miss都进行cache update的那些。 

'Since the item being evicted may be more valuable than the item being inserted in its place, cache updates can be 
detrimental to the cache hit rate.'

An alternative solution: Lazy adaptive replacement cache
Limitation: The cache filter is always operational. may also prevent important items to get in. 

This paper proposes mARC. 
The basic idea of mARC is to avoid unnecessary cache updates. 

It defines three states of workload at a given time: Stable, Unstable and unique access. 
and selectively disable cache update depending on the state. 

Actually there is a very good sentence for us to use: 
'Accurately tracking the active/unique page sets and their relative imporantence is expensive. '

因此，本文采用了一个比较轻的度量，也就是cache hit rate。
