FTL (Flash Translation Layer)

The feature of SSD is that 
1. the NAND flash cannot be written randomly like memory. Before writting to a certain page, the content of that page needs to be deleted at first. 
   So if SSD still follows this rule, then it would be very hard to use. Because the most time would be consumed on deleting. The principle of SSD is
   very similar to log-structured storage. So the new write do not need to write to the former page, it can just be written to a new one. The FTL can 
   map this new one to the that data. 
   
2. Why garbage collection
   Since the page is never updated by a in-place-update way, when a page is re-mapped, the old one would be expired. So we need garbage collection. 
   However, since the erasure needs to be done at the block level, the GC needs to do some data migration during the collection. This would have some 
   negative impact on the global write performance. 


Description from CAFTL paper in FAST'11:

Flash memory has three critical technical constraints. 

(1) no in-place overwrite. 
(2) no random writes. - the pages in an erase block must be written sequentially. 
(3) limited erase/program cycles. - an erase block can wear out after a certain number of erase/program cycles.

In order to solve the problems, the FTL is designed like the followings, 

(1) Indirect mapping
(2) Log-like  write mechanism - each write to logical page only invalidates the previously occupied physical page. 
(3) wear-leveling, since writes are often concentrated on a subset of data, which may cause some blocks to wear out earlier 
than the others. So the FTL tracks and shuffles hot/cold data. 
(4) over-provisioning - in order to assist garbage collection, SSD manufactures usually include a certain amount of over-
provisioned spare flash memory space in addition to the host-usable SSD capcity. 

let's think about why prosioning space can make longer lifespan of SSD devices. For instance, when we just want to write 
4KB data, but there is no avaliable space. However, some block contains garbage which can be collected. In this case, the 
SSD needs to read all the 512KB block, erase the block, update the 512KB. 

Only the OSs which support trim instruction can benefit from the garbage collection. 

Then garbage collection needs to have some avaliable space to temporarily put the data in.
