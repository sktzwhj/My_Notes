Summary: This paper shows a system called Blockstack which builds the DNS on bitcoin blockchain. The paper shows that how 
to overcome the limitations of existing blockchain in bootstrap time, security, etc. 
There are some tradeoffs when we build a blockchain based system. 

1. Running a smaller blockchain may have some security issues. 
2. There is currently a significant difference between the network reliability of the largest public blockchain network
(Bitcoin) and network reliability of the long tail of alternate blockchains.

What I like about this paper?

I think this paper introduces many useful tradeoffs we may meet when deploying a blockchain systems. 

What I dislike about this paper?

I guess too much pre-knowledge is needed for reading this. 

My questions: 
(1) "there is a large mining pool that is either intentionally refusing or is unable to package transactions in the blocks it is 
writing" - I don't quite understand this. Or in specific, what is self-mining, shy that happens?

(2) Can you give a simple explaination about why off-chain storage still provides security guarantee?
