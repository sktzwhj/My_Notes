Actually, in primary storage systems, the duplicates are not an obvious thing. The benefits we can get from dedup rely 
on different workloads. So it becomes significant to estimate the duplicates in a workload. However, considering the
computation overhead, we must find a way to use some samples to accurately estimate the duplications in the storage. 

This paper claims that their method is a content-aware method because the blocks with the same fingerprints are either
both included or excluded from the samples. 

The estimation of duplicates can also be indicate as the estimation of the unique blocks. 

Since the distribution of the workloads is complicated, the sampling method often introduce inaccuracy. Worse, if we want
to get more accuracy, we need to nearly scan the whole data set.

So let's see given a dataset consisting of a group of data blocks (of fixed size or variable size) with possible duplicates. 
how to predict the space that can be saved by dedup. We define, 

R = Size in bytes of distinct blocks in the dataset / Size in bytes of the data set

fingerprint Mod M = X 

tht total size of the distinct blocks in the sample is used to estimate the total size of the distinct blocks in the 
entire data set

由于这里作者采样的是那些模M为X的值，这里定义S*为估计的总的distinct block的size 

S* = M*sigma(ni*si) i is [1,K]

因此，预估的去重率应当是 S*/S_dataset

那么，这个工作的关键是最后估计的错误率和filter之间存在什么样的关系呢？

err = (S - S*)/S

作者数学证明了用较小样本集合就可以得到精确结果的可行性．

对于我们的启示是，对于inline的dedup来说，有多大的收效实际上是和workload紧密相关的．因而也更加证明了application level的信息对于inline 
primary storage当中的dedup的重要性．
