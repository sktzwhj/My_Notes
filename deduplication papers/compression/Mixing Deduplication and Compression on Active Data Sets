Some aspects from this paper. 

in a processor-constrained system, dedup before compression may be preferred to reduce the volume of data to compress. 

So it seems that compress is more computing-intensive. 

the data reduction of primary storage can achieve from 0.8 to 0.3. (free 20% to 70% of disk footprint)

Compression before deduplication does not show very notable difference compared to comparession after dedup.

even for high-entropy medical images, the benifit of data reduction can be around 20%.
