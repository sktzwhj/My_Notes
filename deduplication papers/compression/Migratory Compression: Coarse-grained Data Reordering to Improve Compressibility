In mc, similar data chunks are re-located together. 

delta-compression

there is a tradeoff between compuation and compressibility. 

there are various of methods to improve compressibility:  
(1) increasing the look back window, because when the window size if larger, we would have more 
opportunity to find redundant data
in real applications, to consider about the perfomrance, the window size is not big. the compression with largest window size is 7z (about 1GB)

(2) reordering data 
an useful method is bwt. 
the tool of this paper (mc) is a preprocessor which can be combined with arbitary adaptive lossless compressors such as gzip, bzaip2, etc.
