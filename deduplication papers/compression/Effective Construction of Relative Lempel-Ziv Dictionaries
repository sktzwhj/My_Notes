Dr Wang introduces this to me to inspire our design of cache management in our dedupe system. 

The basic content of this paper is: 

For LZ-like compression algorithms, the compression benefits vary from the dictionaries since they are dictionary based 
compression algorithms. So we should find a good way to remove the strings in dictionary which do not occur very often. 
In contrast, we keep more strings with high frequency to improve the efficiency of dictionary. 

But I think it is not proper to adopt this method in our system because it is an offline method while our system is an inline
system.
