Findings from this paper: 

(1) In backup storage, the size of files is much larger. 

(2) The count of directories are much smaller. 

(3) In terms of file age, larger files are older. 

(4) Filesystem churn is a measure of the percentage of storage that is freed and then written per time period. (e.g., a week)

(5) Of course, backup storage is write-dominate. 

(6) Replication, 

(7) Capacity Utilization, compared to backup storage, primary storage may emphasize more on performance. 

(8) Deduplication rates. 

(9) how does cache work for improving read efficiency?

There are three main differences between read and write cache analysis. The first is that read caches contain the data whereas
the write caches only needs the chunk fingerprints.
