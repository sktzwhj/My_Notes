Look-ups in the chunk index have been the main performance bottleneck in deduplication systems as the complete index is typically 
too large to be held in main memory. 

In order to fit the fingerprints in the memory, existing efforts are (1) reduce the detection rate of dedup. (2) exploit 
chunk locality. (to make full use of the benefits of cache)

However, the concern of this paper is that there might be a lot of parallel backup streams. To this end, the cache would be 
polluted again and again. 

So the contributions of this paper is that the authors build a system which could handle many streams and avoid the memory 
problem. 

In general, the idea of this paper is to sort the streams to avoid random access thus making better use of the cache. 

Another interesting thing mentioned in this paper is about dedup in distributed enviroment. The client firstly send the 
fingerprints to the servers. The servers check the existence of these fingerprints and give some feedback. To this end, 
only the data which is not duplicated needs to be transfered so that the traffic is saved.
