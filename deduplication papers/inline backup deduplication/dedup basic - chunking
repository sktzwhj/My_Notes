This notes is to introduce the basic knowledge about chunking. 

unique hash of block = block identifier is actually a content-addressable store idea. 

Let's talk about content-defined chunking. 

the content-defined chunking uses rabin-fingerprint algorithm. The basic idea of CDC is like the followings, 

there is a sliding window which goes along the file, and calculate the hash of the data in the window. Once the hash 
satisties a certain rule, then it would be regarded as a boundary. Compared to fixed-size chunking, this method is not 
sensitive to the slight change of file. However, using this algorithm is like a tradeoff. If the window size is too 
small, then it would be computing-intensive. If not, the size of blocks would be very large.
