Summary: 

This article introduces the two main methods in deep learning - CNN and DBN. Meanwhile, it also provides some new architectures
for deep learning. Deep learning is still in its eraly age. In the future, sparse coding and semi-supervised manifold learning
,etc can be promising research directions. 

What I like?

A good summary of DP. 

What I dislike?

NA.

Discuss questions.

1. In my understanding, the DP neural network has more hidden layer so that it could have more powerful expression ability.,
However, there is a saying that 3-layer neural network can express almost all functions. So what are the main purposes of 
the additional layers? For choosing features?
