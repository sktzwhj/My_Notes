Summary: 
Data-centric cloud services are not flexible for different tenants. This paper tries to propose a model which integrates functional and 
data perspectives in one coherent framework to solve this. 

What I like about this paper?
N/A

What I dislike about this paper?
(1) I think this paper is not a high-quality paper. 
(2) The written is quite sloppy. Bad formating and a lot of grammatical errors. 
(3) Not a good conference. 
So maybe next time it is good to choose a high-quality paper from top conference rather than a relevant paper with low quality which might 
mislead you.

Can be improved?
(1) Re-formating 
(2) double-check the words and sentences
(3) Pay attention to the figures (small font, etc.)

Discussed questions:
(1) I do not why their solution makes sense. I do not understand the relationship between their arguments and thier solution. 
i.e., How can they solve the problem if some information is private.
