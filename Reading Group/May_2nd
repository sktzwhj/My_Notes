Summary: 
This paper provides a solution to extract the root cause of events from the log of business process. The steps of the solution is to build a graph from decomposition, candiate causal factor selection and casuality detection. 

What I like about this paper?
Clear logic, well written. 

What I dislike about this paper?
I think causality detection should have been explored in many areas. (e.g., you can easily google out many) It seems the related work isn't covering this. It would be better to say why the solutions in those areas are not applicable. 

Can be improved?
As mentioned. 

Discussed question
1. Can causality be regarded as the correlation considering the time order? Say, for two events with stong positive correlation, the former causes the latter one.
