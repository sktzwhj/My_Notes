Summary: 
This paper proposes to use blockchain to achieve provenance for the data in cloud storage. 

What I like about this paper?
Seems relevant to my research. storage...

What I dislike about this paper?
The idea seems to be quite direct. The novelty is limited. 

Can be improved?
The figures and the layout do not seem to be quite professional... Should be polished further...

Discussed questions.
1. Not familiar with the implementations. But do people doing blockchain research believe this is a novel design? Seems they just use blockchain in a direct manner.
