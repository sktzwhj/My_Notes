for inline storage systems

the characteristics are, 

(1) latency sensitive

to this end, fingerprint look up is very time-consuming. but if we use compression, how big should the window size be?

(2) for backup stream, chunks following a duplicate chunk are likely to be duplicates too. 

primary inline and deduplication seems to be a conflict. 

(3) achieving high write throughput should avoid expensive disk index lookups by having an effective chunk-hash cache.
