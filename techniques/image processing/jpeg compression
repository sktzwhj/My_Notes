A brief introduction about jpeg compression. 

The basic process of jpeg compression is: 
(1) partition the image data into 8x8 blocks. 
(2) apply DCT transformation to transform the info from time domain to frequency domain.
(3) apply quantization table on the data after transformation. 
(4) apply entropy encoder to compress the data (huffman coding or arithmetic coding.)

Acually, jpeg is a lossy compression method. It is mainly due to the quantization table. 

Then some introduction about lepton compression. 

Lepton is an open-source jpeg compression method proposed by Dropbox. 

Because in jpeg, one of the 64 coefficient is DC which is 直流分量, this represents the brightness of the entire block of 
8x8 pixels. The other 63 coeffients are the AC part. Jpeg also do some encoding on this part. So basicly, AC part is the 
details of the image. 

So why Lepton can get such good result? The reason is that it uses arithemetic encoding and the DC coefficient is lastly 
encoded.
