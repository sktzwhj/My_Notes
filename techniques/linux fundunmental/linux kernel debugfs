Have read about how FIU collects their traces for the dedupe paper in FAST'11. It seems they use a customed blktrace to do
so. Moreover, blktrace gets the data from debugfs which is temporary file system built in linux operating systems. 

Debugfs can put some kernel data to user space so that we can access it. 

Blktrace get data from debugfs to do the tracing. So if we want to get the hash of content of block data, we need to let 
debugfs to output them. 

After discussed with Dr Li, we have an alternative solution to do this. We could use Network Block Device to do this. What 
we need to do is to extract the read and write requests in nbd-server side. To be specific, if there is some code which is 
used for parsing the packets, we can get the traces there.
