In UNIX OSs, there are some system calls on manipulating files and dirs. For instance, 
fstat and stat 
access(const char *path, int mode) could support test the access of a file with certain modes. 
lstat can get the information of a symbolic link rather the file it points to. 

chmod chdir ... all these functions are avaiable.

telldir & seekdir can record and restore the position of the directory stream. 

we can define our customed compare function for comparing the dirs
