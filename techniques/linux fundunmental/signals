what is unix signal?

signal is a kind of async software interrupts. a signal must be registered before the signal's arrival. 

a signal will suspend the execution of the program. the signal handling procedure then invokes the registered function or 
action. the function is called signal handler. 

the API for signal is 

sig_t signal(int sig, sig_t func);

the former is the sig to register while the latter is the signal handller. 

the values for func can be SIG_DFL (default signal action), SIG_IGN(ignore the singal) and function pointer. 

but the old signal API is not reliable (details see the book unix in practice. ) there are some new APIs for this. like 
this: 

sigemptyset(3)
sigfillset(3)
sigaddset(3)
sigdelset(3)

sigismember(3) is used to test if the signal is a member of the given signal set. 

sigaction(2) is used to query and set signal actions when using a reliable signals. 

there is also mask to block other signals when a certain signal is being processed. It is like the levels for interrupts.
