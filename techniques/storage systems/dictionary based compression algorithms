Here, taking some notes about dictionary based compression algorithms like LZ algorithms. 

This kind of algorithms encode the data by the existing data by using distance+length, the distance is the distance between 
current data and its earlier occurrence while the length is the length of this repetition. 

Some optimizations like zip also encode the distance by huffman coding. And there is some localities so that the distance may
not be very long.
