Talk with Mike Gigante, 

Outline, 

Intro about myself. And Dr Peter Chubb introduces you to me. 

My idea about file system and storage research 

Currently, my interest is focused on data deduplication in storage systems including file system. Especially in distributed storage 
systems. To be specific, how to route the data writes to different storage servers to gain more deduplication ratio and compressibility. 

I find that it seems very hard to improve the performance of file system by designing today. I think the trend is that even we have 
more and more data, a lot of data is duplicated. So it seems easier to improve the efficiency of storage systems by deduplication. 

So I hope to get some advices from you about the real challenges in industry. 

For example, what are the most serious problems for storage industry. 

Actually, an SSD is written only for 1 to 3 times a day.

It would be an interesting idea for sharding the namespace.  

And to have a hierarchical structure. For instance, have a special routing for critical things. And a usual routing for general things. 

So the topic can be how to scale up dedup storage systems to get a approximate linear performance improvement. 

When we are keeping writing small files, the metadata in distributed storage (especially when we hope to do some dedup)

for SSD, the layout of data is quite important. 

new hardware - SMR (Singled Magnetic Recording) -see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingled_magnetic_recording. SMR might provide 
large volume. However, currently, the performance is bad.
