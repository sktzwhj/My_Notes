1. If our architecture is designed for long-term, how can we evaluate that. 

2. The application level information can be classified into instant information like user id and 
photo tag. It can also be some information that needs to be identified by some machine learning 
techniques in long time. I think the design is quite different among these two. 

3. Any comments to the current architecture. 

4. Can the estimator be real-time estimator?
