Thanks a lot to Min that his literature review is quite insightful. 

There are some useful discoveries in this paper. 

(1) the deduplication ratio for HPC storage is often 15% - 30% which is much less than PC systems. 
(2) although the deduplication ratio for small files is larger, but useless for the global dedup ratio..
(3) the dedup ratio for compressed data is very low...obviously
(4) the duplication among data sets is very small
(5) file-level dedup ratio is often 5% - 10% which is much smaller compared to block-level. 
(6) when the block size grows, the dedup ratio decreases slowly.
(7) 3.1% - 9.4% blocks are zero-block.
(8) small amount of data contributes to the major ref count.
