For people who have knowledge about the traditional software testing, it is good to understand
this paper by comparisons.

This paper is the whitebox testing for deep learning systems. Similar to software testing, the main
target of the paper is to find the corner errors of deep learning models.

Similar to traditional software testing, the code coverage is a problem. If we only generate
some synthetic data, we may only cover a very small portion of the situations. Based on this,
this paper propose a concept called neuron coverage.

Code coverage does not apply for DL systems. This is because the logic of DL systems is not only
shown by the code. But parameters.
